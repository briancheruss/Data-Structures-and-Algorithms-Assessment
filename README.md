## Data Structures and Algorithms Project
This project contains Python implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. The goal is to demonstrate the implementation of three different functionalities:

### Stacks:
Implementing a function is_balanced(expression) to check whether a given expression containing parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets is balanced.

### Sequences (Lists/Tuples):
Writing a function remove_duplicates(sequence) to remove duplicates from a given sequence (list or tuple) while maintaining the original order of elements.

### Dictionaries:
Implementing a function word_frequency(sentence) to calculate the frequency of each word in a given sentence, ignoring punctuation and considering words in a case-insensitive manner.
